						<h2>Peter A. Thorne</h2>
						<p class="bio-subhead">Board Member</p>
						<p>Peter was introduced to Innovation Institute by a co-worker at the International Linguistics Center at Dallas, TX.  As he got to know Harrold Andresen and saw him using personal skills to help wheelchair users, Peter also felt God's call to help meet needs that are often overlooked.</p>
						<p>Peterâ€™s primary working experience is in facilities management for a large non-profit mission organization.  He retired in 2010 and began volunteering regularly with Innovation Institute in early 2011. He joined the board in 2013.</p>
						<p>Peter has a BSCE from University of Illinois and is certified as an energy auditor by the Association of Energy Engineers. He and his wife, Donna, have three sons, two of whom were disabled for parts of their lives.  His youngest son works in a post doctoral position in cell developmental research at UT Southwestern in Dallas, Texas.</p>
